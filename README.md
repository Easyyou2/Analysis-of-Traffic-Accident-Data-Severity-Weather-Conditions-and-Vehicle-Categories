The Traffic Accident Data Visualization and Analysis project aims to analyze and visualize traffic accident data to gain insights into the factors contributing to accidents and their severity. The project utilizes data from 1999-2014, which includes information on accident severity, weather conditions, vehicle types, and more. 


The data used in this project is provided in the `data/2019_dataset_en.csv` file. This dataset contains information about traffic accidents that occurred in 2019, including details such as accident severity, weather conditions, vehicle types, and more.


To run the analysis, follow these steps:

1. **Install R**: Ensure you have R installed on your system. You can download it from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).
2. **Install R Packages**: Install the necessary R packages by running the following command in your R console:
    ```R
    install.packages(c("dplyr", "tidyr", "ggplot2"))
    ```
3. **Run the Script**: Open the `R/analysis_script.R` script in your R environment and run the script to generate the visualizations.
